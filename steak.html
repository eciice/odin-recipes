    <!--The step by step recipe tutorial-->

    <ul>  <h3>1 ingredients</h3>
        <li>3 pound Porterhouse steak</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of Mediterranean sea salt</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (optional for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <ul><h3>2 Preparation:</h3>
        <li>Take the steak out of the refrigerator and let it come to room 
            temperature for about an hour before cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill to high heat. The grill should be very hot to
             achieve a good sear on the steak.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul><h3>3 Grilling</h3>
        <li>Grill steak over direct head for 5-7 minutes each side, or until
            internal temperature reaches 120-125F</li>
        <li>For grill marks and nice crust, avoid moving the steak once on the grill</li>
    </ul>

    <ul><h3>4 Resting</h3>
        <li>Once the steak reaches your desired doneness, remove from grill and
            allow it to rest for 5-10 minutes to let internal juices redistribute.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul><h3>5 Serving</h3>
    <li>Slice the steak against the grain for tenderness</li>
    <li>Serve with lemon wedges on the side for fresh burst of flavor</li></ul>

    <p>Enjoy your Bistecca alla Fiorentina with a sie of roasted vegetables, a fresh salad,
        and a glass of Tuscan red wine for an authentic dining experience!
